# Minecraft Security System
 
A websocket-based security system designed for the Minecraft mod `ComputerCraft`, specifically `CC: Tweaked`. Integrates with Amazon API Gateway (an Amazon Web Services product), though could be adjusted to fit any websocket API.

Could also be improved to be compatible with `OpenComputers`.
